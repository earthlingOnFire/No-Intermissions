WHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?
- This mod skips the intermission cutscenes that happen at the end of each act.
- This means that, after 3-2 ends, you will go directly to 4-1, skipping the intermission cutscene and the "Insert Disc 2" part. Likewise, when you finish 6-2, you will go to 7-1 directly.

HOW DO I INSTALL THIS MOD MANUALLY?
- First, install BepInEx. If you have used Ultrakill mods in the past, you should probably have it installed already.
- Then, simply drag the "NoIntermissions.dll" file to the BepInEx/plugins folder in your game files.
